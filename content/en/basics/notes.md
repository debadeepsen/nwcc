## Who this is for

This tutorial is aimed at serving three different kinds of people.

1. Developers, specifically Node.js developers who are trying to expand their realm of expertise into automation testing.
2. Manual QA personnel, who want to learn automation strategies.
3. Business owners and architects trying to gauge whether test automation is good for the development process and the business in the long run (it is\!)

## Scope limitations

1. This tutorial only covers integration of Nightwatch with Cucumber. Nightwatch, as mentioned earlier, uses Selenium under the hood, and Selenium can be coded for and run with other programming languages too. Cucumber step definitions can also be written using a variety of languages, but all of that is outside the scope of this tutorial.
2. While knowledge of, or experience with Node.js is not _required_, it would certainly be helpful to have that while going through this tutorial. If you have not used Node.js before, you might need to familiarize yourself with some of the basics. That is left as an exercise to the reader; this tutorial does not aim to address that.
3. This tutorial makes use of `npm`, the default Node.js package manager. There are other alternatives to `npm`, most notably [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), that you might like to investigate for yourself.
3. This documentation is currently in English only. Future effort might involve supporting other locales, such as French or Spanish.

## Tools used
